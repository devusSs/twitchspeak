### twitchspeak by devusSs ðŸš€

Twitchspeak is an http and oauth based integration tool to combine [TeamSpeak 3](https://teamspeak.com) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv). While there is a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) connection setting in the [TeamSpeak 3](https://teamspeak.com) client settings I have not found any usability or purposeful usage for it.

So I designed this app for people to host it next to their [TeamSpeak 3](https://teamspeak.com) server to enable people connecting their [TeamSpeak 3](https://teamspeak.com) client with their [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) account to be able to gain certain rights or send certain commands on the [TeamSpeak 3](https://teamspeak.com) server.

It's a project in progress and has not been officially released as of December 2nd 2023.
